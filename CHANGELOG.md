# Changelog

All notable changes to the Wingman Claude Code plugin.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-07-13

### Added — vendor pattern integration (v9–v12)
- **v9 — Subagent-Driven Development**: fresh subagent per task with a post-task spec + quality review (`commands/build.md`, `skills/subagent-driven-development`).
- **v10 — Doc-Index**: discoverable index discipline so `references/*.md` stay findable and cited (`skills/doc-index`).
- **v11 — Council**: four-voice decision council for ambiguous calls (`commands/council.md`, `skills/council`).
- **v12 — TDD + Maintenance**:
  - Red-green-refactor TDD (`skills/test-driven-development`, `skills/testing-patterns`, `references/testing-patterns.md`) with an 80% coverage floor.
  - 5 skill descriptions rephrased to the `Use when...` trigger form (ponytail-debt-harvesting, platform-native-reference, verification-loop, interview-one-question-at-a-time, evidence-gated-catalog); `## Verification` added to `interview-one-question-at-a-time`.
  - Security/threat-register re-schematization (`commands/secure.md`, `skills/security-checklist`) with a mandated `Disposition / Acceptance` column.
  - Over-engineering 5-tag taxonomy (`commands/over-engineering-review.md`), whole-repo bloat audit (`commands/bloat-audit.md`), and a debt ledger (`commands/debt-ledger.md`).
  - Ponytail-derived minimalism tooling: `engineering-minimalism`, `platform-native-reference`, `ponytail-debt-harvesting`, `verification-before-completion` enhancements, `definition-of-done`.

### Fixed
- **Critical (found by `/wingman:audit`)**: `boardroom-checkpoint.mjs`'s `ExitPlanMode` gate over-blocked — it validated required sections against *every* source including inline plan text (which has no section headers), denying every ExitPlanMode. Now each source is judged independently and an approved checkpoint requires the marker **+** `ship it` **+** all 7 sections. Regression test added in `tests/hooks-integration/hooks-integration.test.mjs`.

### Security
- `/wingman:secure` threat register re-schematized; `threats_open = 0` at release.
- `/wingman:harness` gained bloat (files >200 lines, functions >50 lines) and debt-ceiling (`// minimal:` ceiling hits) checks.

### Maintenance
- 85/85 tests pass (84 + 1 regression); `validate-structure` → 0 warnings; `check-repo-consistency` → PASS.
- `/wingman:audit` (systematic-auditing, 4 parallel subagents), `/wingman:retro`, and `/wingman:learn` artifacts written under `docs/wingman/`.
- `ATTRIBUTIONS.md` provenance record covers all 16 vendor repos.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-08
- Initial shipped plugin: 13 `wingman:*` pipeline/adaptive commands, 5 `boardroom-*` agents, 10 skills, the `boardroom-checkpoint.mjs` hook, and the mechanical validators. (See `docs/PROJECT.md` decisions log for the full history.)
