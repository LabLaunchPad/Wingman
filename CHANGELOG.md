# Changelog

All notable changes to the Wingman Claude Code plugin.

## [0.5.5] - 2026-07-17

### Fixed
- `validate-structure.mjs`'s hook-event whitelist had a fake event (`StopFailure`) and was missing 3 real ones (`Notification`/`SubagentStop`/`PreCompact`).
- `context-monitor.mjs`'s scope-creep detector read `toolInput.filePath` instead of Claude Code's real snake_case `file_path` field, so it never fired.
- `council`/`verification-loop` skills still pointed at the retired `wingman:secure` command; repointed to `build.md`'s Definition-of-Done gate.
- Removed an exact duplicated section in `verification-before-completion/SKILL.md`; minor consistency fixes in `engineering-minimalism`, `ponytail-debt-harvesting`, and `traceability-linking`.
- Retired `evals/cases/plan.md` (tested a command that no longer exists), matching the existing `secure.md` pattern.

## [0.5.4] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed
- Architecture audit + full remediation loop: closed all findings (Proven + Emerging) from a self-audit pass. See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`'s version history and `docs/PROJECT.md`'s decisions log for details.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-07-15

### Added
- Promoted `git-pr-workflow` skill; closed idle pnpm proposal; closed a 12-case eval-coverage backlog.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-15

### Added
- Dogfooding as a first-class mechanism (`commands/dogfood.md`, `skills/dogfood-gap-classification`).
- AI-native structured logging (`wingman:log` markers across `LEARNINGS.md`/`docs/wingman/retros.md`/decisions log/`docs/HUMAN-TODOS.md`).
- `git-pr-workflow` skill (draft-PR/CI-poll/squash-merge-resync procedure, built on plain `git` + `gh`).

## [0.3.1] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed
- Management Board activation threshold was miscounting the always-active Product/Engineering/QA departments toward its 3+ conditionally-activated-department gate; now only Design/Data/Legal-Security/DevOps/Growth count.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-15

### Changed — MVP1 + MVP2 rearchitecture
- **MVP1**: Boardroom rearchitected from 5 seats to 7 + Design — `boardroom-founder`/`boardroom-engineer`/`boardroom-security`/`boardroom-cost` replaced by `boardroom-ceo`/`boardroom-cto`/`boardroom-ciso`/`boardroom-cfo`, plus new `boardroom-cpo`/`boardroom-cmo`/`boardroom-research` seats. New Management Board layer (9 manager roles, complexity-gated). New Agent Permission Model (`permissions:` frontmatter field on every agent template).
- **MVP2**: replaced the 4-stage `plan`/`build`/`secure`/`ship` pipeline with 7 named stages (`discovery`/`define`/`architecture`/`uxflow`/`implementation-planning`/`build`/`ship`), while reducing founder-visible checkpoints from 4 to 3 (5 planning stages bundle into one Planning Milestone checkpoint). `secure.md` retired as a standalone command; its threat-register discipline moved into `build.md`'s Definition-of-Done gate. New traceability engine (`skills/traceability-linking`, `scripts/check-traceability.mjs`) and deterministic Definition-of-Done structural gate (`hooks/dod-structural-gate.mjs`).
- Closed 15 eval-coverage gaps flagged by `wingman-health.mjs`.

See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §10 (v13-v16) and `docs/PROJECT.md`'s decisions log for full detail on this and the following three releases.

## [0.1.8] - 2026-07-13

### Added — gap-closure batch 6 (cross-cutting: secrets policy + persona library, gap G12)
- **`references/secrets-policy.md`**: the single secrets-handling reference — never persist live keys, use a secret manager, the `secret-guard`/`secret-scanner`/`prompt-guard` hooks enforce at runtime, rotate-on-exposure (pairs with `/wingman:incident`), `gh secret set` guidance.
- **`references/persona-template.md`**: copy-paste scaffold for adding future advisor personas (legal/ops/product) with the required anatomy (`name` + `Use when` + Rationalizations/Red Flags/Verification) and the parallel-fan-out command pattern from `/wingman:advisory`.
- Closes the **last gap (G12)** in the original G1–G12 ledger. `plugin.json` bumped `0.1.7` → `0.1.8`.

### Maintenance
- 112/112 → 114/114 tests pass (added G12 reference-doc tests); `validate-structure` → 0 warnings; `check-repo-consistency` → PASS.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-07-13

### Added — gap-closure batch 5 (incident-response skill + command, gap G11)
- **`skills/incident-response`** + **`commands/incident.md`** (`/wingman:incident`): a calm, ordered runbook for when production is broken or a security event is underway — stabilize, contain (rotate exposed keys), triage, diagnose, communicate, then fix + prevent. Sequencing is the point: stabilize before debugging. Meets the project skill standard.
- `GAPS.md` (G11) marked shipped; `plugin.json` bumped `0.1.6` → `0.1.7` (33 skills, 19 commands); `CLAUDE.md` command list updated.

### Maintenance
- 108/108 → 112/112 tests pass (added incident-response skill anatomy + command tests); `validate-structure` → 0 warnings; `check-repo-consistency` → PASS.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-07-13

### Added — gap-closure batch 4 (simplify skill, gap G10)
- **`skills/simplify`**: a post-change tidy-up pass — remove duplication, collapse indirection, delete dead branches, and undo needless cleverness before code sets. Renders a simplification *plan* and never edits working code silently; pairs with `engineering-minimalism` and `/wingman:harness`'s bloat checks. Adapted from `obra/superpowers`' simplify discipline (MIT), restated in Wingman's own words. Meets the project skill standard.
- `GAPS.md` (G10) marked shipped; `plugin.json` bumped `0.1.5` → `0.1.6` (32 skills).

### Maintenance
- 105/105 → 108/108 tests pass (added simplify anatomy tests); `validate-structure` → 0 warnings; `check-repo-consistency` → PASS.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-07-13

### Added — gap-closure batch 3 (code-review skill, gap G9)
- **`skills/code-review`**: a plain-language second pass on code quality before ship — correctness, security, simplicity, and test coverage called out in founder terms. Reviews the diff only, rates findings (Blocker / Should-fix / Nit), and returns a one-line bottom line; it never edits code itself. Complements the engineering Boardroom seat and `/wingman:audit`. Meets the project skill standard (name + `Use when` description + Rationalizations/Red Flags/Verification).
- `GAPS.md` (G9) marked shipped; `plugin.json` bumped `0.1.4` → `0.1.5` (31 skills).

### Maintenance
- 102/102 → 105/105 tests pass (added code-review anatomy tests); `validate-structure` → 0 warnings; `check-repo-consistency` → PASS.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-07-13

### Added — gap-closure batch 2 (output secret-scanner, gap G4)
- **`hooks/secret-scanner.mjs`** (`PostToolUse`, matchers Bash/Read/Write/Edit/NotebookEdit): defense-in-depth companion to `secret-guard` (G1). Scans a tool's *response* for surfaced secrets (AWS keys, GitHub PATs, `sk-` keys, PEM private keys, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=`) and warns the founder via stderr. **Warn-only by design** — it never blocks legitimate reads, avoiding the over-block trap fixed in v12. Pure `scan()`/`redact()`/`findSecrets()` are unit-tested.
- Wired into `hooks/hooks.json` `PostToolUse`.
- `GAPS.md` (G4) marked shipped; `plugin.json` bumped `0.1.3` → `0.1.4`.

### Maintenance
- 97/97 → 102/102 tests pass (added secret-scanner hook assertion + unit + integration tests); `validate-structure` → 0 warnings; `check-repo-consistency` → PASS.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-07-13

### Added — gap-closure batch 1 (curated founder-lens vendor mining)
- **Founder Intelligence**: `skills/memory` (durable cross-session memory) and `skills/research` + `commands/research.md` (source-grounded, cited briefs).
- **Business Advisory**: `skills/founder-cfo` / `founder-cmo` / `founder-cro` (plain-language finance/marketing/revenue verdicts) and `commands/advisory.md` (parallel fan-out-merge of all three, mirroring `/wingman:boardroom`).
- **Safety Hooks (gaps G1–G3)**: `hooks/secret-guard.mjs` (`PreToolUse` Bash/Write/Edit/NotebookEdit — blocks destructive commands and secret writes), `hooks/stop-loop.mjs` (`Stop`, opt-in autonomous loop via `.wingman/loop.json`), `hooks/prompt-guard.mjs` (`UserPromptSubmit`, prompt-injection defense). All three wired into `hooks/hooks.json`.
- **Gap catalog**: `docs/wingman/GAPS.md` — living, founder-lens gap ledger (G1–G12) produced by the vendor-mining loop; drives future batches.
- **Vendors added** (reference-only submodules): `alirezarezvani/claude-skills`, `jeremylongshore/claude-code-plugins-plus-skills`, `ComposioHQ/awesome-claude-skills`, `avelikiy/great_cto`. `ATTRIBUTIONS.md` updated.

### Maintenance
- 30 skills, 18 commands, 5 agents. `plugin.json` bumped `0.1.2` → `0.1.3`.
- 97/97 tests pass (added secret-guard / stop-loop / prompt-guard unit + integration tests); `validate-structure` → 0 warnings; `check-repo-consistency` → PASS.
- **Known (pre-existing, environmental) failure**: `scripts/check-fixtures.mjs` errors on Windows because it shells out to `/bin/bash` for `evals/fixtures/*.sh`; unrelated to this change and not part of CI (CI runs validate/actionlint/install-smoke/version-gate only).

## [0.1.2] - 2026-07-13

### Added — vendor pattern integration (v9–v12)
- **v9 — Subagent-Driven Development**: fresh subagent per task with a post-task spec + quality review (`commands/build.md`, `skills/subagent-driven-development`).
- **v10 — Doc-Index**: discoverable index discipline so `references/*.md` stay findable and cited (`skills/doc-index`).
- **v11 — Council**: four-voice decision council for ambiguous calls (`commands/council.md`, `skills/council`).
- **v12 — TDD + Maintenance**:
  - Red-green-refactor TDD (`skills/test-driven-development`, `skills/testing-patterns`, `references/testing-patterns.md`) with an 80% coverage floor.
  - 5 skill descriptions rephrased to the `Use when...` trigger form (ponytail-debt-harvesting, platform-native-reference, verification-loop, interview-one-question-at-a-time, evidence-gated-catalog); `## Verification` added to `interview-one-question-at-a-time`.
  - Security/threat-register re-schematization (`commands/secure.md`, `skills/security-checklist`) with a mandated `Disposition / Acceptance` column.
  - Over-engineering 5-tag taxonomy (`commands/over-engineering-review.md`), whole-repo bloat audit (`commands/bloat-audit.md`), and a debt ledger (`commands/debt-ledger.md`).
  - Ponytail-derived minimalism tooling: `engineering-minimalism`, `platform-native-reference`, `ponytail-debt-harvesting`, `verification-before-completion` enhancements, `definition-of-done`.

### Fixed
- **Critical (found by `/wingman:audit`)**: `boardroom-checkpoint.mjs`'s `ExitPlanMode` gate over-blocked — it validated required sections against *every* source including inline plan text (which has no section headers), denying every ExitPlanMode. Now each source is judged independently and an approved checkpoint requires the marker **+** `ship it` **+** all 7 sections. Regression test added in `tests/hooks-integration/hooks-integration.test.mjs`.

### Security
- `/wingman:secure` threat register re-schematized; `threats_open = 0` at release.
- `/wingman:harness` gained bloat (files >200 lines, functions >50 lines) and debt-ceiling (`// minimal:` ceiling hits) checks.

### Maintenance
- 85/85 tests pass (84 + 1 regression); `validate-structure` → 0 warnings; `check-repo-consistency` → PASS.
- `/wingman:audit` (systematic-auditing, 4 parallel subagents), `/wingman:retro`, and `/wingman:learn` artifacts written under `docs/wingman/`.
- `ATTRIBUTIONS.md` provenance record covers all 16 vendor repos.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-08
- Initial shipped plugin: 13 `wingman:*` pipeline/adaptive commands, 5 `boardroom-*` agents, 10 skills, the `boardroom-checkpoint.mjs` hook, and the mechanical validators. (See `docs/PROJECT.md` decisions log for the full history.)
